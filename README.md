# My simple blog newsletter application

This is a React application for doing typical CRUD operations over my short thoughts
that will later be dispatched to my subscribers as newsletter.

## API

For storing my short thoughts I will use Infobip Catalog API.
Possibly will implement 2FA with Infobip SMS API and contacts list with Infobip People API. 

## FRONTEND

As mentioned above, I will be using React and try to implement as many modern ECMAScript features
with a goal to make the application good performance-wise and easy to read for any future developers 
interested in working on this project.
For styling, I will probably use React-Bootstrap library, as well as some plain CSS. 
Design **`must`** be responsive

## FEATURES

* Login, Registration, 2FA

* Implemented markdown

* CRUD operations over notes




### ***README file will be updated with future commits and possible new features***
