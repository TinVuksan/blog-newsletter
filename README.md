# My simple blog newsletter application

This is a React application for doing typical CRUD operations over my short thoughts
that will later be dispatched to my subscribers as newsletter.

## API

For storing my short thoughts I will use Infobip Catalog API.
Possibly will implement 2FA with Infobip SMS API and contacts list with Infobip People API. 

## FRONTEND

As mentioned above, I will be using React and try to implement as many modern ECMAScript features
with a goal to make the application good performance-wise and easy to read for any future developers 
interested in working on this project.
For styling, I will probably use React-Bootstrap library, as well as some plain CSS. 
Design **`must`** be responsive

## FEATURES

* Login, Registration (2FA not quite...)

* Implemented markdown

* CRUD operations over notes

* Basic CI/CD setup using Github Actions

* Deployed via Github Pages

## Outro

This page was created by Tin Vuk≈°an. This project has taught me a couple of new things, 
but it has definitely shown me a whole bunch of stuff I still can't wrap my head around.
While developing this project, I have learned about CI/CD and building pipelines, I have started to 
understand the process of two-factor authentication and deployment (*and some of the absolute horrifying thoughts and pain you endure in the process of it*)
